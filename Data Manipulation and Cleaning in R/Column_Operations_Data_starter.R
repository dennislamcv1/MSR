# Ungraded Lab: Column Operations Practice

# Install necessary packages (if not already installed)
# install.packages("tidyverse")  # This line installs the tidyverse package, which includes dplyr and readr.

# Load the tidyverse library
library(tidyverse)  # This loads the tidyverse package, making its functions available.

# ================================================
# Activity 1: Load and Examine the Data
# ================================================

# Load the retail dataset (retail_set5.csv)
customer_data <- read_csv("retail_set5.csv")  # read_csv() from the readr package reads the CSV file into a data frame.

# Examine the data structure
str(customer_data)  # str() shows the structure of the data frame, including column names and data types. This helps understand the data's organization.

# ================================================
# Activity 2: Separating Combined Address Data
# ================================================
# Separate the address column into street, city, state, and ZIP code.

# Example:
# Separate the combined 'address' column

# customer_data_clean <- customer_data %>%
#  separate(Address, into = c("street", "city", "state_zip"), sep = ", ")


# Try it Out #1 : For customers in the Phoenix and Seattle regions, separate the address column into street, city, and state_ZIP code.

# <YOUR CODE HERE>

# ================================================
# Activity 3: Uniting Customer Name Columns
# ================================================
# Let's say an example dataset includes first_name and last_name fields and you wanted to convert these into a single, formatted "full_name" column. You could use code similar to the following:
# Example
# Unite names into a single column
# names_united <- customer_data %>%
#  unite(full_name, first_name, last_name, sep = " ")


# Try it Out #1 : Combine FullName and CustomerID fields into a single, formatted "FullName_ID" column. Save to variable called names_united.

# <YOUR CODE HERE>

# ================================================
# Activity 4: Manage Addresses with Custom Separators
# ================================================
# Separate combined address data using ";" as a custom separator.

# Example dataset
# address_data <- data.frame(
#  customer_id = c(101, 102, 103),
#  address = c("10 Elm Street;Boston;MA;02101", 
#              "42 Oak Road;Austin;TX;73301", 
#              "425 Vine St.;Seattle;WA;98101"))

# Separate columns using ";" as the separator
# address_data_clean <- address_data %>%
#  separate(address, into = c("street", "city", "state", "zip"), sep = ";")

# Try it Out #1 : For older customer records using semicolons, separate the 'address' column into street, city, state, and zip.

# <YOUR CODE HERE>


# ================================================
# Bringing it all Together
# ================================================

# Step 1: Unite FullName and CustomerID into a single column
customer_data <- customer_data %>%
  ________(FullName_ID, FullName, CustomerID, sep = " ")

# Step 2: Separate the 'Address' column into street, city, and state_zip
customer_data_clean <- customer_data %>%
  ________(__________,
           into = c("________", "________", "________"),
           sep = ", ")

# Step 3: Preview the cleaned data
________(customer_data_clean)
